            <h1>ArmWrestling Rules</h1>
            <h2>Even a strong athlete who has been going to the gym for years can lose a fight.</h2>
            <h3>You don't have to be a super athlete to beat everyone in armwrestling. An athlete can beat even the most pumped-up guy in armwrestling if he knows the right technique. The most important thing in this sport is a strong hand.</h3>

            <h2>Here you will find all the necessary guidelines and rules to follow during arm wrestling matches.</h2>
            <h3>Correct stance<br>
                Step 1: Grasp the pin with the non-working hand. Important: do not let go of the pin completely.<br>
                Step 2: The athlete's hands are positioned so that the grip is in the middle, with the phalanges of the fingers open. Important: the fingers of the opponent must not be covered.<br>
                Step 3. Athletes' shoulders should be parallel to the table.<br>
                Step 4. The elbow of the wrestling hand rests on the cushion on the table. Important: it is allowed to slide the elbow on the cushion, but it is not allowed to pull the elbow away from it.<br>
                Step 5: Get into a position that is comfortable for you. You can even rest your feet on the legs of the table on which you are fighting. Important: if your feet are in the way of your opponent, the referee will stop the game.</h3>
