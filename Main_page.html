        <h1 class="title">ARMWRESTLING</h1>
        <p><span>ARMWRESTLING</span> - is a strength sport in which two athletes grip each other's hand. 
            The goal is to pin the other's arm onto the surface, the winner's arm over the loser's arm.
            The sport is often casually used to demonstrate the stronger person between two or more people. 
            Arm wrestling is an ancient sport that was revived in the 1950s in the United States. In September 1962, 
            the first world wrestling championship was held in Petaluma, California, as this wrestling was called (literally, “wrist wrestling”). </p>
