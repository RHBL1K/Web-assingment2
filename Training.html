        <h1>ArmWrestling Training</h1>
        <h2>The first thing you should do in the gym is not to develop your endurance or form a beautiful relief, but to strengthen your arms. You will need exercises for biceps, triceps, broad back muscles and deltoids.<br>
            Here are the exercises you can use to strengthen your arms for arm wrestling:</h2>

            <h2>Wrist flexion with barbell</h2>
            <h3>Barbell curls strengthen forearm flexors and improve grip strength. Sit on a bench with your forearms on your thighs and your wrists hanging over the edge. Grab the barbell with a bottom grip and slowly raise it up, bending only your hands, then lower it back down. Keep your forearms still and control the movement. Do not overload the weight and perform the exercise smoothly.</h3>

        <h2>Arm strength is an important part of a successful fight, but it is by no means the only part. It is important to remember the importance of practising techniques. There are many of them, and the main thing is to find a few of the most suitable ones for you and regularly allocate time to practise them.</h2>
